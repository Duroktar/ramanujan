The Tao of Microservices teaches you the path to understanding how to
apply microservices architecture with your own real-world
projects. This high-level book offers you a conceptual view of
microservice architectures, along with core concepts and their
application. You'll also find a detailed case study for the
nodezoo.com system, including all source code and documentation. By
the end of the book, you'll have explored in depth the key ideas of
the microservice architecture and will be able to design, analyze and
implement systems based on this architecture.
